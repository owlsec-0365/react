# Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with a modern tech stack featuring a React frontend and Express.js backend. The project follows a monorepo structure with separate client and server directories, along with shared code. The application appears to be a login/authentication system with a Microsoft-inspired UI design.

The frontend uses React with TypeScript, Vite as the build tool, and shadcn/ui components for a polished user interface. The backend is built with Express.js and includes database integration using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL support.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on top of Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation resolvers

## Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon Database)
- **Session Management**: Uses connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-based session storage
- **Development**: Hot module replacement and error overlay for development experience

## Project Structure
- `/client` - React frontend application
- `/server` - Express.js backend API
- `/shared` - Shared TypeScript types and database schema
- `/migrations` - Database migration files generated by Drizzle

## Database Design
The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following schema:
- **Users table**: Stores user credentials with id (UUID), username (unique), and password fields
- **Schema validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking and validation

## Development Workflow
- **Monorepo setup**: Single repository containing both frontend and backend
- **Type sharing**: Common types and schemas shared between client and server
- **Development server**: Vite dev server with Express API proxy
- **Build process**: Separate build processes for client (Vite) and server (esbuild)

# External Dependencies

## Database Services
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL database platform
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migration and introspection tools

## UI and Styling
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Google Fonts**: Web fonts (Segoe UI as primary, with fallbacks)

## Development Tools
- **Replit Integration**: Custom Vite plugins for Replit development environment
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for server-side code
- **PostCSS**: CSS post-processing with Autoprefixer

## Runtime Dependencies
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management and validation
- **Wouter**: Lightweight routing library
- **Date-fns**: Date manipulation utilities
- **Class Variance Authority**: Utility for creating type-safe component variants
- **clsx**: Utility for constructing className strings conditionally

The application is designed to be deployed on Replit with development-specific tooling and optimizations, while maintaining production-ready architecture patterns.
